# seniorProject_spiderSpeciesRecognition
Applying Computer Vision Methodologies to Classify and Recognize Species of Arachnids
This repository contains my senior project for Spring 2017 from the University of Texas ast Rio Grande Valley. 
The authors of this project include myself and my advisor Dr. Mahmoud Quwieder.

This program takes in an image of a spider and returns the species of that spider.
